10,11/7/2011,9:47,There was so much more I wanted to do
11,11/7/2011,9:48,Ahhh well time to move on
12,11/7/2011,9:48,My thought process is too crazy
13,11/7/2011,9:48,I totally think I’m bipolar
14,11/7/2011,9:48,Or just crazy
15,11/7/2011,9:49,Idk.
16,11/7/2011,9:49,Humm I remember why we broke up
17,11/7/2011,9:50,I shall do it again
18,11/7/2011,9:50,Because this time I don't have a bf
19,11/7/2011,9:50,And I really don't care anymore
20,11/7/2011,9:51,I should get ready then
21,11/7/2011,9:51,Should have gotten everything last night
22,11/7/2011,9:52,Still just trying to raise my numbers
23,11/7/2011,9:52,So I met this boy
24,11/7/2011,9:52,He was very cute you see
25,11/7/2011,9:52,Quite popular too
26,11/7/2011,9:53,Me and this boy started talking
27,11/7/2011,9:53,Then we talked a lil more
28,11/7/2011,9:53,Then he let me in his front door
29,11/7/2011,9:54,We walked up the stairs where everything was quite
30,11/7/2011,9:54,And he whispered 'you look beautiful' into my ear
31,11/7/2011,9:55,Shivers moved down my spine
32,11/7/2011,9:55,And then he began to kiss my neck
33,11/7/2011,9:56,I know you're thinking 'why did she Go'
34,11/7/2011,9:57,And all I can say is my father told me so
35,11/7/2011,9:57,So he kissed me sweet and laid me down on his bed
36,11/7/2011,9:58,I started to shake he said 'give me head'
37,11/7/2011,9:58,I laughed at him and said 'I'm a vegetarian'
38,11/7/2011,9:59,Then I wondered why I had really come to him.
39,11/7/2011,9:59,See I've been in this situation before
40,11/7/2011,10:00,When a boy I loved said he would leave if I didn't give it up
41,11/7/2011,10:00,And I told my friends I had done it even though it wasn't true
42,11/7/2011,10:01,Because he was telling everybody the same things too
43,11/7/2011,10:01,But here is the honest truth
44,11/7/2011,10:01,I never did it till I was sixteen
45,11/7/2011,10:02,I did not know the boy
46,11/7/2011,10:02,And I never got to know him
47,11/7/2011,10:02,He was older stronger and high at the time
48,11/7/2011,10:03,He probably will never admit I was a crime
49,11/7/2011,10:03,His breath smelt sour like smoke and his kisses became rough
50,11/7/2011,10:04,Then I tried to sit up and say 'I've had enough'
51,11/7/2011,10:04,My attempt of getting free were feeble
52,11/7/2011,10:05,I decided to scream 'please stop'
53,11/7/2011,10:05,but he just took a pillow to my face and put me in the dark
54,11/7/2011,10:06,First to go were my shoes. I feel my feet go cold
55,11/7/2011,10:06,"Next my pants, he was so bold."
56,11/7/2011,10:07,It hurt so much as he entered me
57,11/7/2011,10:07,Guys I'm telling you my first time was taken from me
58,11/7/2011,10:08,He noticed and said 'are you a virgin?'
59,11/7/2011,10:08,I nodded through tears as he kept barging in
60,11/7/2011,10:09,He finished and was done with me
61,11/7/2011,10:09,I lay on his bed lifeless
62,11/7/2011,10:10,He let me stay there and sleep
63,11/7/2011,10:10,Then he offered me some weed
64,11/7/2011,10:10,I said 'no thank you I don't do that either'
65,11/7/2011,10:11,He said 'girl you're no fun. See you later'
66,11/7/2011,10:12,I started to get dressed and he came back in
67,11/7/2011,10:12,He came close; i tried to get away from him
68,11/7/2011,10:12,He told me 'dont be scared' 
69,11/7/2011,10:13,and like an idiot I believed him
70,11/7/2011,10:13,He asked if I liked it
71,11/7/2011,10:14,I shrugged my shoulders
72,11/7/2011,10:14,"He leaned in for a kiss, and I let him"
73,11/7/2011,10:15,He laid me down and rubbed my back
74,11/7/2011,10:15,I cried in his pillow. He cried back
75,11/7/2011,10:15,He said he was sorry
76,11/7/2011,10:16,I said 'it's okay'
77,11/7/2011,10:16,we laid there together just bathing in our fears
78,11/7/2011,10:17,I don't know why. I saw the human in him.
79,11/7/2011,10:17,He was probably just as broken as me
80,11/7/2011,10:17,He drove me to my park
81,11/7/2011,10:18,I got on the swirly slide. I just laid there and cried
82,11/7/2011,10:19,I finally walked home
83,11/7/2011,10:19,My father opened the door
84,11/7/2011,10:19,Asked me 'how was it'
85,11/7/2011,10:20,I said 'i'll never forget it…'
86,11/7/2011,10:20,as he pressed for questions. I grew impatient
87,11/7/2011,10:20,Said 'dad in so tired can I just go to bed'
88,11/7/2011,10:21,he dismissed me and I trudged up the stairs.
89,11/7/2011,10:21,My legs hurt. And my heart was filled with despair
90,11/7/2011,10:21,I went to the bathroom and locked the door
91,11/7/2011,10:22,I took apart a razor I had just gotten from the store
92,11/7/2011,10:22,I did what I had to do to forget.
93,11/7/2011,10:23,It seems it's been my only way since sixth grade
94,11/7/2011,10:24,When the kids called me fat even though I was a double zero
95,11/7/2011,10:24,And I began to watch my weight like it was a MTV show.
96,11/7/2011,10:25,I cried as I remembered how I'd starve for days
97,11/7/2011,10:25,And my parents never noticed
98,11/7/2011,10:26,So I laid there and watched the blood gather on the floor
99,11/7/2011,10:26,Then my weak hands reached for the door
100,11/7/2011,10:27,I ran into my little sister she saw and shook her head.
101,11/7/2011,10:27,Then she looked at me and said. 'Just don't let them see sissy.'
102,11/7/2011,10:27,she kissed my head and walked away
103,11/7/2011,10:28,I swear after that night I was never the same
104,11/7/2011,10:28,My dad became to want 'favors' from me too
105,11/7/2011,10:29,He would use it to bribe me if I wanted to hang out after school
106,11/7/2011,10:30,I didn't know that I should have told somebody what he was doing to me
107,11/7/2011,10:30,Sex just became second nature to me
108,11/7/2011,10:31,My father let me as long as he got details sometimes I'd even have to let him see
109,11/7/2011,10:32,I was just a young girl. Who quickly became afraid of men.
110,11/7/2011,10:32,Then years past and it never stopped.
111,11/7/2011,10:32,Finally on day I began to pop
112,11/7/2011,10:33,I sent a boy away
113,11/7/2011,10:33,And told my father enough was enough
114,11/7/2011,10:33,He cried and said 'I'm just so weak'
115,11/7/2011,10:34,I looked at him and saw the brokenness too
116,11/7/2011,10:34,I took pity on him and became the fool
117,11/7/2011,10:35,Things never changed they just got worse
118,11/7/2011,10:35,Till one day I met a boy who in the end hurt my heart worst
119,11/7/2011,10:36,We met in my typical situation
120,11/7/2011,10:36,We were both undressed within a matter of seconds.
121,11/7/2011,10:37,But I could tell he was different.
122,11/7/2011,10:37,I pledged myself by not hooking up with complete strangers
123,11/7/2011,10:38,But for him I was eager
124,11/7/2011,10:38,But there was something different about this guy
125,11/7/2011,10:39,He returned the favor and actually said goodbye
126,11/7/2011,10:40,On the bus ride home we sat next to each other. Talked for hours on end
127,11/7/2011,10:40,We held each other's hands and told each other our favorite bands
128,11/7/2011,10:41,He looked me dead in the eyes and asked if I would please consider seeing him again
129,11/7/2011,10:42,I went home filled with smiles and cheer
130,11/7/2011,13:01,Annyways. The guy eventually asked me to be his girl
131,11/7/2011,13:02,And things were great for a while
132,11/7/2011,13:04,But my dad got in the way. And ruined everything. One day I just couldn't do it. So I told my boyfriend my secret
133,11/7/2011,13:06,What happened next was a blur. I told him not to tell. We tried to act normal. We had been dating for over a month when I took his virginity
134,11/7/2011,13:07,I fell in love for the first time. But my secret was too much for him. He needed time to think. I thought I was going to lose him.
135,11/7/2011,13:09,A lot happened. But all that matters is that my secret was about to become public. Him & my friends made me tell
136,11/7/2011,,All my efforts to keep a normal life were crumbling right before my eyes.
137,11/7/2011,13:11,I remember telling my closest teacher and CPS and the police and dectectives. I remember having to tell them everything about my dad
138,11/7/2011,13:35,It was my boyfriend who told my mom. And she came to get me.
139,11/7/2011,13:37,Weeks passed then I got the call. They said. 'Sorry but there isn't enough evidence' I hung up.
140,11/7/2011,13:38,That's when I changed. I didn't care anymore. And the people I was meeting gave me no reason to.
141,11/7/2011,13:39,"The guys I've been with, ha none of them care. They just look at me like I'm just some other hoe."
142,11/7/2011,13:40,To that I say. I guess I am . I don't know how else to be. It's not my fault. Somebody else chose that for me.
143,11/7/2011,13:47,Well that's. The story of how I came to be who I am. Well the condensed version. I'd love to hear what you have to say. But I won't be around
144,11/7/2011,14:08,Take two. Hope I get this right.
